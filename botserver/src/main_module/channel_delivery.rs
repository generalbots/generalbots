//! Delivery of bot replies that have no live response channel.
//!
//! A channel reply normally travels through `AppState::response_channels`: the
//! pipeline registers a sender for the conversation while the inbound request
//! runs and the channel adapter forwards whatever arrives on it. A tool
//! triggered by `ON EVENT` runs in the background, so its `TALK` reaches this
//! layer after that registration is gone and used to be dropped with
//! `send_message: NO channel for session …` — the media-filing confirmation,
//! for example, never reached Telegram even though the file was filed.
//!
//! This module closes that gap for the channels whose adapter can address a
//! recipient on its own: `BotResponse.channel` selects the adapter and
//! `BotResponse.user_id` is the recipient that adapter expects (a Telegram chat
//! id for `TALK` coming from a channel event). Channels without an
//! addressable adapter keep the previous behavior — a warning and no delivery
//! — instead of silently pretending to have sent the message.
