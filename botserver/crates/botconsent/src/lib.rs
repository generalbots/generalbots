//! General Bots per-app agent consent system (issue #1176).
//!
//! Executors call [`authorize`] before performing an application action; a
//! missing grant produces a five-minute [`PendingRequest`] rendered as an
//! HTMX consent card. Users resolve prompts through `/api/consent/resolve`;
//! `allow_once` payloads are handed back to executors via
//! [`take_pending_approved`]. Sensitive action classes (`payment`) ignore
//! stored "always" grants once the monthly cycle ends.
