-- #1441 A3 — `crm_deals.lead_id` is the "converted from this lead" pointer, but
-- migration 6.2.3-01-crm-deals declared it as a foreign key to `crm_leads(id)`.
-- This deployment stores leads in `crm_deals` itself (`crm_leads` is empty), so
-- `POST /api/crm/leads/:id/convert` always failed with
-- `crm_deals_lead_id_fkey` — the Lead → Opportunity flow dead-ended at the last
-- step and the Opportunities grid could never show a converted lead.
--
-- The constraint is repointed at `crm_deals(id)` (a self-reference), which is
-- what the handler actually writes. Legacy pointers that do not resolve inside
-- `crm_deals` are detached first so the migration cannot fail on old data.
