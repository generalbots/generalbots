IF INSTR(LOWER(choice), "forecast") > 0 THEN
    TALK "How many days? (1-5)"
    HEAR days
    
    IF NOT IS_NUMERIC(days) THEN
        days = 5
    END IF
    
    result = FORECAST city, days
    TALK result

    result = WEATHER city
    TALK result
END IF

TALK "Is there another city you'd like to check?"
```

## Weather-Based Automation

```basic
' weather-alert.bas
' Send alerts based on weather conditions

cities = ["New York", "London", "Tokyo", "Sydney"]

FOR EACH city IN cities
    weather = WEATHER city
    
    ' Check for extreme conditions
    IF INSTR(weather, "storm") > 0 OR INSTR(weather, "heavy rain") > 0 THEN
        SEND MAIL "alerts@company.com", "Weather Alert: " + city, weather
    END IF
NEXT
```

## Daily Weather Report

```basic
' daily-weather.bas
' Generate a daily weather report for multiple locations

locations = ["San Francisco,US", "Austin,US", "Seattle,US"]
report = "☀️ Daily Weather Report\n\n"

FOR EACH loc IN locations
    weather = WEATHER loc
    report = report + weather + "\n\n---\n\n"
NEXT

' Send the compiled report
SEND MAIL "team@company.com", "Daily Weather Update", report
```

## Travel Planning Assistant

```basic
' travel-weather.bas
' Help users plan travel based on weather

TALK "Where are you planning to travel?"
HEAR destination

TALK "When are you planning to go? (Please provide a date)"
HEAR travel_date

' Get forecast for destination
forecast = FORECAST destination, 5
TALK "Here's the weather forecast for " + destination + ":"
TALK forecast

TALK "Based on the forecast, would you like packing suggestions?"
HEAR wants_suggestions

IF LOWER(wants_suggestions) = "yes" THEN
    weather = WEATHER destination
    
    IF INSTR(weather, "rain") > 0 THEN
        TALK "🌂 Don't forget to pack an umbrella and rain jacket!"
    END IF
    
    IF INSTR(weather, "Temperature: 2") > 0 OR INSTR(weather, "Temperature: 3") > 0 THEN
        TALK "🩳 It's warm! Pack light clothing and sunscreen."
    ELSE IF INSTR(weather, "Temperature: 0") > 0 OR INSTR(weather, "Temperature: 1") > 0 THEN

## Configuration

To use the weather keywords, configure your OpenWeatherMap API key in `config.csv`:

| Key | Description | Required |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| `weather-api-key` | OpenWeatherMap API key | Yes |

### Getting an API Key

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in your dashboard
4. Generate a new API key
5. Add to your bot's `config.csv`:

```csv
weather-api-key,your-api-key-here
```

## Wind Direction Compass

Wind direction is converted from degrees to compass directions:

| Degrees | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| 0° | N (North) |
| 45° | NE (Northeast) |
| 90° | E (East) |
| 135° | SE (Southeast) |
| 180° | S (South) |
| 225° | SW (Southwest) |
| 270° | W (West) |
| 315° | NW (Northwest) |

## Error Handling

```basic
' Handle weather API errors gracefully
ON ERROR GOTO weather_error

weather = WEATHER "Unknown City XYZ"
TALK weather
END

weather_error:
    TALK "Sorry, I couldn't get weather information for that location."
    TALK "Please check the city name and try again."
END
```

## Rate Limits

The OpenWeatherMap free tier includes:
- 60 calls per minute
- 1,000,000 calls per month

For higher limits, consider upgrading to a paid plan.

## Best Practices

1. **Use country codes**: For accuracy, include country codes (e.g., "Paris,FR" instead of just "Paris").

2. **Cache results**: Weather data doesn't change frequently—consider caching results for 10-15 minutes.

3. **Handle timeouts**: Weather API calls have a 10-second timeout. Handle failures gracefully.

4. **Validate locations**: Check if the location is valid before making API calls.

5. **Localization**: Consider user preferences for temperature units (Celsius vs Fahrenheit).

## Fallback Behavior

If the OpenWeatherMap API is unavailable, the system will:
1. Log the error
2. Attempt a fallback weather service (if configured)
3. Return a user-friendly error message
