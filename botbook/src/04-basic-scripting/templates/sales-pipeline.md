## Keywords Used

| Keyword | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ADD TOOL` | Register pipeline management tools |
| `USE KB` | Load sales methodology knowledge base |
| `SET CONTEXT` | Define sales assistant behavior |
| `ADD SUGGESTION` | Create quick action buttons |
| `BEGIN TALK` | Welcome message with options |
| `BEGIN SYSTEM PROMPT` | Sales stage definitions and guidelines |

## Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Win Probability | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| new | 10% | Initial contact, not qualified |
| qualified | 30% | BANT criteria confirmed |
| proposal | 50% | Quote or proposal sent |
| negotiation | 70% | Active deal discussions |

> **Note**: The new unified CRM uses `crm_deals` table with stages: `new`, `qualified`, `proposal`, `negotiation`, `won`, `lost`. Use `department_id` to filter by business unit (e.g., Comercial SP, Inside Sales, Enterprise).

## Department Filtering

Filter deals by business unit using `department_id`:

```basic
' Filter deals by department
deals = FIND "crm_deals", "department_id = '" + departmentId + "' AND stage != 'won' AND stage != 'lost'"

' Get department stats
SELECT pd.name, COUNT(cd.id) AS total_deals, COALESCE(SUM(cd.value), 0) AS total_value
FROM people_departments pd
LEFT JOIN crm_deals cd ON cd.department_id = pd.id
WHERE pd.org_id = $1
GROUP BY pd.id, pd.name
```

## Customization Ideas

### Add Deal Scoring

```basic
' Calculate deal score based on various factors
score = 0

' Company size score
IF deal.company_size > 1000 THEN
    score = score + 20
ELSE IF deal.company_size > 100 THEN
    score = score + 10
END IF

' Budget confirmed
IF deal.budget_confirmed THEN
    score = score + 25
END IF

' Decision maker engaged
IF deal.decision_maker THEN
    score = score + 25
END IF

' Timeline urgency
IF DATEDIFF(deal.expected_close, NOW(), "days") < 30 THEN
    score = score + 20
END IF

' Competitor involved
IF deal.competitor THEN
    score = score - 10
END IF

deal.score = score
TALK "Deal Score: " + score + "/100"
```

### Add Activity Tracking

```basic
ADD TOOL "log-activity"

PARAM deal_id AS STRING DESCRIPTION "Deal ID"
PARAM activity_type AS STRING LIKE "call" DESCRIPTION "Type: call, email, meeting, demo, proposal"
PARAM notes AS STRING DESCRIPTION "Activity notes"

WITH activity
    deal_id = deal_id
    type = activity_type
    notes = notes
    user = USERNAME
    timestamp = NOW()
END WITH

SAVE "deal_activities.csv", activity

' Update deal's last activity date
UPDATE "deals.csv" SET last_activity = NOW() WHERE id = deal_id

TALK "✅ Activity logged for deal " + deal_id
```

### Add Win/Loss Analysis

```basic
ADD TOOL "win-loss-report"

won = FIND "deals.csv", "stage = 'closed_won' AND closed_date >= '" + start_date + "'"
lost = FIND "deals.csv", "stage = 'closed_lost' AND closed_date >= '" + start_date + "'"

won_count = UBOUND(won)
lost_count = UBOUND(lost)
win_rate = (won_count / (won_count + lost_count)) * 100

won_value = 0
FOR EACH deal IN won
    won_value = won_value + deal.value
NEXT

TALK "📊 **Win/Loss Analysis**"
TALK ""
TALK "**Win Rate:** " + FORMAT(win_rate, "#0.0") + "%"
TALK "**Deals Won:** " + won_count + " ($" + FORMAT(won_value, "#,##0") + ")"
TALK "**Deals Lost:** " + lost_count
TALK ""
TALK "**Top Loss Reasons:**"
' Aggregate loss reasons...
```

### Add Email Integration

```basic
' Send proposal email from pipeline
ADD TOOL "send-proposal"

PARAM deal_id AS STRING DESCRIPTION "Deal to send proposal for"

deal = FIND "deals.csv", "id = '" + deal_id + "'"

' Generate proposal from template
proposal = FILL "proposal-template.docx", deal

' Send email
SEND MAIL deal.contact_email, "Proposal for " + deal.company, 
    "Please find attached our proposal.\n\nBest regards,\n" + USERNAME,
    proposal

' Update deal stage
deal.stage = "proposal"
deal.proposal_sent = NOW()
UPDATE "deals.csv", deal

TALK "📧 Proposal sent to " + deal.contact_email
TALK "Deal moved to Proposal stage."
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Deals Updated**: Update deal stages promptly for accurate forecasting
2. **Log Activities**: Track all customer interactions
3. **Use BANT**: Qualify deals properly before advancing
4. **Clean Pipeline**: Remove stale deals regularly
5. **Review Weekly**: Check pipeline health and forecasts weekly
